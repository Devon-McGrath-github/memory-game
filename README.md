# Memory Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), then built with improving at react as the core goal. The implementation is likely sub optimal, but I wanted to improve my understanding of Asynchronous API calls, Hooks, Context and useReducer so I implemented all these in the project.

Based on the assignment from the Odin Project [Memory Card Game Exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card).

### If you clone the Repo, run via the following:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
